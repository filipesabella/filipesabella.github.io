  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>"x-percent-time" is the benefit some companies provide their employees, in
    which an individual is allowed, usually on a weekly basis, to spend that
    amount of time doing something else other than their usual backlog work.</p>

  <p>During my time at SoundCloud, the company had a 20% time rule for
    engineers.
    In short, it meant that every engineer was allowed to work one day per week
    on
    whatever they wanted.</p>

  <p>The use of the word "whatever" in the previous sentence was carefully
    thought
    out. When I joined the company, there was a very short document with a
    handful
    of examples of what were good examples of how to spend that time, and that
    was
    all.</p>

  <p>In this article, I am going to describe the problems we had with the
    process,
    and what we did to get it to good shape.</p>

  <h1>Benefits</h1>
  <p>When asking around about it, I remember many engineers mentioning that this
    was one of the reasons they stayed in the company. We learned that this
    benefit, when applied correctly, can be a big retention factor.</p>

  <p>Every other possible benefit really does depend on how you organise it, and
    what activities engineers engage on during this time. It can be learning,
    actually producing useful prototypes, give time for the teams to think
    outside
    of the box, etc.</p>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
  <p>The following were the most common problems we found with the
    already-in-place process.</p>
  <p>The goal here is to share possibly common pitfalls, regardless of how your
    context is configured.</p>

  <h2>Lack of engagement</h2>
  <p>Some people used it every week, however most people didn’t use it at all.
  </p>
  <p>We didn’t spend enough time to understand all the underlying reasons for
    this, however a few were more apparent:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>People felt pressured to do backlog work instead of working on something
      else.</li>
    <li>Managers didn’t promote it well enough within the teams.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Lack of accountability</h2>
  <p>Given the free format, most people worked on "random" things that, most
    times, didn’t have a tangible output. "I’m going to play with this new
    technology", "I’m going to read more about this library".</p>

  <p>No tracking of the work was done in terms of cards in the backlog, or a
    demo
    to the team, etc.</p>

  <p>While this is not inherently bad, it does challenge the usefulness of
    the
    time spent.</p>

  <p>This lack of accountability led to a few issues in which it became
    painfully
    obvious that, in some cases, people were taking their 20% to escape work for
    a
    day once in a while. In these cases, people would usually work from home,
    despite the company not having this culture at the time.</p>
  <p>Since this benefit was given to all engineers, teams felt powerless to try
    and fix it.</p>

  <h2>Didn’t promote cross-team or department collaboration</h2>
  <p>Since people took their days randomly throughout the week, and many times
    telling their teams the night before, there wasn’t much collaboration on
    projects across teams coming out of it. It happened from time to time, but
    too
    sparsely to count.</p>

  <h2>Creating work for other teams</h2>
  <p>On many occasions, mostly from old-timers, someone would go rogue and fix
    or
    implement features on systems that were taken care of by another team,
    without
    communicating before starting the work.</p>

  <p>That ended badly in one of two ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The team takes on the maintenance work of what was produced, having to
      shuffle priorities, or</li>
    <li>The team rejected the work.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Promoting to production</h2>
  <p>Spikes and prototypes sometimes were deemed good and that they should go to
    production.</p>
  <p>How to do it? Which team is going to change priorities to make it
    production
    ready and ship it?</p>

  <h2>Cheating on backlog priorities</h2>
  <p>Surprisingly, this was one of the top complaints from teams. An engineer
    wouldn’t agree with the team’s prioritisation of the backlog for a given
    sprint, so would use their 20% time to "cheat", and work on something that
    had
    been deprioritised, instead of making their point and committing as a team.
  </p>

  <h2>Overall</h2>
  <p>As you might have concluded, many of these problems could, most likely,
    have
    been prevented by a more mature leadership team. This lack of maturity
    paired
    with a strong-willed engineering culture, which is a good thing, led to
    these
    problems persisting for a few years.</p>

  <h1>Fixing it</h1>
  <p>When the engineering management team started to grow at SoundCloud (a tale
    for another time), the issues described previously started to become a
    recurring topic. Also, during engineering retrospectives, engineers
    themselves
    became more vocal about the problems.</p>

  <p>Eventually we got to focus our attention on fixing it.</p>

  <p>The hottest topic was what should be allowed during the 20% time.</p>
  <p>After many interviews and meetings, we reached the conclusion that pursuing
    an "allow-list" of topics was an unfruitful endeavour. With over a hundred
    engineers in dozens of teams, contexts were too different, it wouldn’t work.
  </p>

  <p>Instead, following the overall leadership style of Richard Durnwall at the
    time, we decided on a very small set of rules that mainly promoted in-team
    decision making.</p>

  <p>The rules were as follows:</p>

  <h2 class="no-number">1. Must be done in the office, every Friday</h2>
  <p>This aimed to address accountability, cross-team collaboration, and it also
    helped to increase awareness to the other departments, since everyone knew
    that Friday was 20%-time day.</p>

  <h2 class="no-number">2. A card must be put in the backlog during sprint
    planning</h2>
  <p>Since all teams organised their work in two-week sprints, and those were
    all
    synchronised throughout the company, this rule made sense.</p>

  <p>The goal was also to increase accountability, as the cards had to move
    through the pipeline, and eventually be marked as done.</p>

  <h2 class="no-number">3. Any team member can veto any suggestion</h2>
  <p>This one was very contentious, and my introduction to how hard it is to do
    mass-communication over documents. I remember spending an afternoon having
    conversations with the authors of many of the fifty-something comments on
    the
    one-page document’s sidebar.</p>

  <p>The goal of this rule was to give an opportunity to any team member to
    challenge an activity. In the end, naturally, no one ever used it (we
    asked),
    but it just stated clearly that 20% time was also about the team, that
    backlog
    priorities shouldn’t be cheated, that one shouldn’t work on something that
    would create work to another group.</p>

  <p>It also gave the opportunity for team members to collaborate on something.
  </p>

  <h2 class="no-number">Name rebrand</h2>
  <p>The previous unofficial, but widely used name, for 20% was "Hacker Time".
    We
    felt that this wasn’t incredibly inclusive given all the possibilities of
    usage of this time. </p>
  <p>Also in hopes of increasing awareness and thus, engagement, we renamed it
    to
    something not very good, but that stuck to this day: <strong>Self-Allocated
      Time</strong>, or SAT for short.</p>

  <p>Not the most eloquent idea, but it did the trick.</p>

  <h1>Learnings</h1>
  <p>The most important one was that <strong>no process will save you from
      lacking
      management skills</strong>.</p>

  <p>And the other one was to <strong>trust teams to make decisions that affect
      their context, but provide guidelines</strong>.</p>

  <p>I would also strongly recommend <strong>against</strong> using this time to
    pay off technical debt. This kind of work must be accounted for using your
    team’s normal planning methods.</p>

  <h1>Criticism</h1>
  <p>At the time, when we were working on changing Hacker Time, one person was
    vocal about abolishing all together.</p>
  <p>Their argument was that whatever is done in 20% time should actually be
    organised as normal work or a particular activity.</p>

  <p>Leaning new tech? Should have workshops and such.</p>
  <p>Prototypes? Should be organised as normal work.</p>
  <p>Spiking out new approaches? Also planned as normal.</p>

  <p>While I do agree that they were absolutely correct, my counter-argument at
    the time was that we were not mature enough as an organisation to have that
    time planned out correctly for every activity and team.</p>
  <p>20% time was a kind of safety net for activities that
    <strong>should</strong>
    be organised, <strong>but weren’t</strong>. At the same time providing
    engineers with more autonomy.</p>

  <h1>At SoundCloud</h1>
  <p>Disclaimer: I left the company in 2017, a little over two years ago now.
  </p>

  <p>When new engineers joined the company, most would use their first few weeks
    of SAT to learn Scala, the programming language used in most product teams
    at
    the time.</p>

  <p>Other than this, most would use it to play with and learn new technologies,
    spike out new technical approaches, or pay some old ownerless technical
    debt.
  </p>

  <h1>Conclusion: should you do it?</h1>
  <p>When I joined SoundCloud, Hacker Time had already been in place for a few
    years. I couldn’t really imagine the engineering team without this benefit,
    and they do it to this day.</p>

  <p>If you are to try it out, definitely do it as an experiment, with a start
    and
    end date.</p>

  <p>You will have to convince other stakeholders that this is useful in some
    way.
    Agree with them what is the expected output of the experiment, and try it
    out.
